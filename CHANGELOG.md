# Changelog

## 1.1.1 — 2026-04-26

### Security

- Block `javascript:` / `data:` URIs in third-party photo links via a
  `safeHttpUrl()` allowlist
- Require `X-Requested-With` header on watchlist `POST` / `DELETE` (CSRF
  defence — browsers cannot set custom headers cross-origin without a CORS
  preflight that this app rejects)
- Cap watchlist `value` (64 chars) and `label` (255 chars) lengths at the
  Pydantic-model layer; the same caps are enforced in the Telegram `/watch`
  bot command path
- Show only the database filename, not the full path, on `/settings`
- `safeHttpUrl()` now returns the trimmed URL for consistency

## 1.1.0 — 2026-04-24

- Receiver health dashboard with metrics time-series (43 columns) and 9
  health checks (heartbeat, aircraft visibility, message rate, signal drop,
  CPU saturation, gain hints, range degradation)
