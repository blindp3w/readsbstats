# Changelog

## 1.5.1 — 2026-05-09

Production-readiness sweep (seventh audit pass — see
`internal_docs/improvements.md` items #86–101).

### Performance & reliability

- **Per-thread sqlite connections in web** — `web.py::db()` now lazily opens a
  connection per uvicorn worker thread via `threading.local()`. Python's
  per-connection sqlite mutex previously serialised every request through one
  global lock, throwing away WAL's reader concurrency.
- **30 read-only `async def` handlers → `def`** — FastAPI now dispatches them
  to its threadpool, freeing the asyncio event loop. Endpoints that genuinely
  `await` (photo fetchers, heatmap/coverage, feeder checks) stay async.
- **Watchdog heartbeat is now its own thread** — `_watchdog_loop()` ticks every
  20 s independent of the poll loop. A write inside `_poll()` can block on the
  SQLite write lock for tens of seconds while a background `CREATE INDEX` is
  running; the previous inline `WATCHDOG=1` would have missed `WatchdogSec=60`
  and had systemd kill the collector.
- **Single-source background migrations** — `run_background_migrations()` now
  runs only in the collector. Web no longer spawns a duplicate thread that
  would race on the same `CREATE INDEX` and `backfill_bearing` UPDATEs.
- **`/api/dates` cached** (TTL 600 s) — was doing a full GROUP BY scan of
  `flights` on every request even though the result only ticks daily.
- **Partial index `idx_positions_ts_coords`** — `ON positions(ts) WHERE lat IS
  NOT NULL AND lon IS NOT NULL`. Speeds up cold-cache heatmap/coverage when
  many MLAT-only rows have NULL coords.
- **Background helpers guard `conn.close()`** — `_build_positions_indexes` and
  `backfill_bearing` no longer mask a real `connect()` failure with
  `UnboundLocalError` from the `finally` block.

### Security

- **Telegram bot token redacted in error logs** — `notifier._describe_exc()`
  formats `urllib.error.HTTPError` / `URLError` without echoing the request URL
  (which contains `/bot<TOKEN>/`). Defence in depth: current stdlib `__str__`
  doesn't leak the URL, but third-party libs and future stdlib changes might.
- **`safeHttpUrl()` tightened to `^https://`** — the third-party photo
  providers (Planespotters, airport-data, hexdb) all serve over HTTPS already;
  rejecting `http://` closes the MITM window for users on hostile networks.
  Does not affect the readsbstats app's own URLs (those are relative and never
  go through this function), so HTTP-only LAN deployments are unaffected.
- **Auto DB snapshot before purge `--apply`** — `database.snapshot_db()` does
  an atomic `VACUUM INTO <db>.backup-<ts>.db` before any of the three
  `purge_*.py` scripts mutate. `--i-have-a-backup` opts out.

### Tests

- 972 Python tests (was 948) + 54 JS tests. New: per-thread connection
  behaviour, watchdog loop lifecycle, Telegram token-redaction caplog
  assertions, partial-index DDL verification, snapshot helper, concurrent
  writer + index builder, `backfill_bearing` against out-of-range coords,
  notifier "Country: Unknown" fallback.

### Cleanup

- Removed duplicate `end = last_update` assignment in `import_rrd.py`
- uPlot chart instances destroyed on `beforeunload` in `metrics.js`
- `safeHttpUrl()` JS test suite updated to lock the new https-only contract

## 1.1.1 — 2026-04-26

### Security

- Block `javascript:` / `data:` URIs in third-party photo links via a
  `safeHttpUrl()` allowlist
- Require `X-Requested-With` header on watchlist `POST` / `DELETE` (CSRF
  defence — browsers cannot set custom headers cross-origin without a CORS
  preflight that this app rejects)
- Cap watchlist `value` (64 chars) and `label` (255 chars) lengths at the
  Pydantic-model layer; the same caps are enforced in the Telegram `/watch`
  bot command path
- Show only the database filename, not the full path, on `/settings`
- `safeHttpUrl()` now returns the trimmed URL for consistency

## 1.1.0 — 2026-04-24

- Receiver health dashboard with metrics time-series (43 columns) and 9
  health checks (heartbeat, aircraft visibility, message rate, signal drop,
  CPU saturation, gain hints, range degradation)
