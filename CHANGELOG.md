# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.8.2 — 2026-05-13

Closes a small daily-summary coverage gap noted while back-filling the
FLAG_ANONYMOUS README documentation in v1.8.1: `send_daily_summary`
emitted Military and Interesting counts but never carried over the
**Anonymous** count, despite the rest of the codebase (badges, web UI,
`/api/stats`, first-sighting Telegram alerts) all treating anonymous
as a peer flag.

### Added

- **Anonymous count in the daily Telegram summary** — the summary's
  aggregate query now OR-merges `aircraft_db.flags` + `adsbx_overrides.flags`
  with the computed anonymous bit (via `icao_ranges.anonymous_flag_sql`),
  applies the same military > interesting > anonymous precedence used
  everywhere else (each flight counts under exactly one kind), and emits
  a new "Anonymous: N" badge alongside "Military: N" / "Interesting: N"
  when N > 0. Zero-suppression matches the existing badges. Four new
  tests in `TestSendDailySummary`: bare anonymous-badge presence, both
  precedence-exclusion directions (military and interesting suppress
  the anon count), and zero-suppression when no anon flights exist.
  Resolves a documentation-vs-behaviour drift surfaced during the v1.8.1
  README anonymous-aircraft pass.

### Changed

- README's daily-summary description (Telegram section) now lists
  `military/interesting/anonymous counts` with an explicit note about
  the shared precedence rule.

### Test counts

- Python: **1188 passing** (was 1184) — +4 from this release.
- JS: 69 passing (unchanged).
- Playwright UI: 35 (unchanged).

## 1.8.1 — 2026-05-13

Follow-up from the eleventh audit pass — bug fixes, a defensive refactor on
the Telegram path, test coverage for the in-process enrichment caches, and
five small cleanups. No new features; deploy is in-place.

### Fixed

- **`/api/metrics` returned HTTP 500 on non-integer `from` / `to`** — the
  handler called `int(request.query_params.get("from", ...))` directly, so
  garbage input bubbled up as `ValueError` and FastAPI mapped it to 500
  instead of 400. Switched to typed `Query(None, alias="from")` parameters
  so the validation layer rejects them at the boundary with 422. Five new
  tests in `tests/test_web.py::TestApiMetricsQueryValidation`.
- **Telegram `/unwatch <hex>` could delete a registration-typed watchlist
  entry with the same literal value** — `_watch_remove` ran `DELETE FROM
  watchlist WHERE value = ?` with no `match_type` filter. Now mirrors the
  `_watch_add` inference (`re.fullmatch(r"[0-9a-f]{6}", value)` → `icao`,
  else `registration`) and adds `AND match_type = ?` to the DELETE. The
  HTTP `DELETE /api/watchlist/{id}` endpoint remains the authoritative
  cross-type removal path. Three new tests pin the behaviour.
- **`scripts/notify-telegram-failure.sh` silently dropped alerts when the
  failing unit's journal contained `<`, `>`, or `&`** — Telegram's
  `parse_mode=HTML` returns 400 on those characters even inside text
  nodes, so a single weird-looking traceback would suppress the very
  alert you most needed. The shell script now pipes `systemctl status`
  output through `sed` to HTML-escape `&`/`<`/`>` (in that order — `&`
  first so it doesn't eat the entities the later substitutions emit)
  before interpolation into the `<pre>...</pre>` block.

### Changed

- **All Telegram outbound calls now route through `http_safe.safe_urlopen`**
  — `notifier._send`, `_send_photo`, and `_get_updates` previously used raw
  `urllib.request.urlopen`, bypassing the central SSRF guard's redirect
  blocker and response-size cap. To make this work for the POSTs,
  `safe_urlopen` gained an optional `data: bytes | None = None` parameter
  that flows into `urllib.request.Request`. All four policies (HTTPS-only,
  public-IP-only, no-redirect, size cap) now apply uniformly to every
  outbound call in the codebase, including `api.telegram.org`. If Telegram
  ever 302s during a region migration, the notifier will surface the
  redirect as a `ValueError` instead of following blindly. Four new tests
  in `test_http_safe.py` cover the POST capability; the existing 13 mock
  sites in `test_notifier.py` were rewritten to patch the new symbol.
- **`templates/base.html` active-nav match now requires a segment boundary**
  — `path.startsWith(href)` would have lit up `/history` on a future
  `/history-archive` path. Tightened to `path === href || (href !== "/"
  && path.startsWith(href + "/"))`. Cosmetic only — none of the current
  nav routes have this collision.
- **`<select>` option value `aero` renamed to `aeronautical`** — matches
  the existing `config.TELEGRAM_UNITS == "aeronautical"` literal in the
  Python notifier. `initUnitSelector()` carries a one-time migration that
  rewrites a stored `"aero"` in `localStorage` to `"aeronautical"` so
  existing users see the correct option highlighted in the dropdown after
  the rename. Frontend behaviour is unchanged in every other respect.
- **`_csrf_check` gained a load-bearing `# CRITICAL` comment** explaining
  that the X-Requested-With header check works *because* this app has no
  CORS middleware that whitelists custom headers. A future engineer
  adding `CORSMiddleware(allow_headers=["*"])` will now hit the warning
  at the diff level.

### Removed

- **Deleted dead code: `static/js/live.js` (116 lines) and
  `templates/live.html` (34 lines)** — the `/live` route has been a
  301-redirect to `/map` since v1.4.0 and never actually rendered the
  template. Pre-flight grep confirmed nothing else referenced them. The
  `/api/live` JSON endpoint (used by the nav live-badge) is independent
  and stays. Tests that probe the `/live` redirect (`test_web.py:750`,
  `test_map.py:228`, `tests/ui/test_mobile_smoke.py:148`) still pass.

### Tests

- **New `tests/test_enrichment.py` (20 tests)** — direct coverage for
  `_LRUDict` (basic put/get, None-as-value vs. miss, eviction at maxsize,
  LRU touch-to-end) and its thread safety (8-thread concurrent put + get
  with 1000 ops each + a concurrent-clear test). Plus negative-cache and
  positive-cache behaviour of `lookup_aircraft`, `lookup_airline`, and
  `lookup_adsbx`, the `invalidate_adsbx` busting path, and `clear_cache`
  resetting all three module-level caches. Closes the longest-standing
  test-coverage hole (the enrichment module was previously covered only
  transitively via collector / web tests).

### Internal cleanups

- Dropped unused `import math` / `import sys` from `scripts/purge_ghosts.py`,
  `scripts/purge_bad_gs.py`, and `scripts/purge_mlat_gs_spikes.py`.
- Tightened the "Background migrations — single owner" paragraph in
  `CLAUDE.md` to spell out which indexes belong in `_migrate()` (small
  `flights` table, e.g. `idx_flights_max_gs` / `idx_flights_max_alt`) vs
  in `run_background_migrations()` (heavy composite/partial indexes on
  the millions-row `positions` table).

### Test counts

- Python: **1184 passing** (was 1152) — +32 from this release.
- JS: 69 passing (unchanged).
- Playwright UI: 35 (unchanged).

## 1.8.0 — 2026-05-13

### Added

- **`FLAG_ANONYMOUS` — surface non-ICAO Mode-S addresses** — a new flag bit
  (16) is computed at query time from `src/readsbstats/icao_ranges.py` and
  OR-merged into every flag projection alongside `aircraft_db.flags` and
  `adsbx_overrides.flags`. An address gets the bit set when it falls outside
  every ICAO state-allocated block — typically military / OPSEC contacts,
  TIS-B / ADS-R rebroadcasts, and MLAT-synthetic identifiers. No DB column,
  no backfill: editing the state-allocation table retroactively reclassifies
  every historical flight on the next query. Motivated by a real-world
  sighting of hex `dd85cb` (a clean westbound transit across central Poland
  whose Mode-S address ADSBExchange flagged as "Non-ICAO hex (dynamic)").
  - **Filters and gallery** — `flags=anonymous` on `/api/flights` and
    `/api/aircraft/flagged` returns anon-only contacts (military / interesting
    take precedence under their own filters, matching the existing
    interesting/military exclusion pattern). The "All" tab on the flagged
    gallery now includes anonymous hits alongside military and interesting.
    New "Anonymous" filter button in `templates/gallery.html`.
  - **UI badge** — `flagBadge()` in `static/js/table-utils.js` gains a third
    branch with a `"?"` short label / `"Anonymous"` long label and a new
    `.badge-anon` CSS class. Precedence stays military > interesting >
    anonymous so the existing badges aren't disturbed.
  - **Stats page** — new "Anonymous" mini-stat alongside "Military" and
    "Interesting" inside the redesigned flagged-flights card.
  - **Telegram alert** — `notifier.notify_anonymous()` fires once per
    first-ever-sighting of a non-ICAO hex (Country line intentionally
    omitted since the address has no state by definition). Gated by
    `RSBS_TELEGRAM_ANONYMOUS_ALERT` (default `1`). `_load_notified()` is
    extended via a `LEFT JOIN` + the anon CASE so a restart doesn't re-fire
    historical anon alerts.
  - **Retention** — `_close_flight()` ghost-purge exemption is extended to
    keep single-position anonymous sightings (same precedent as military /
    interesting). The whole point of the flag is to surface edge-of-range
    contacts, so a one-sample track is exactly what we want to preserve.

### Changed

- **Stats page top-card redesign** — added a third mini-stat (Anonymous)
  next to Military and Interesting. To keep all summary cards at the same
  height, the flagged card now lays its three sub-stats out horizontally
  inside one card that spans two grid cells, with thin vertical separators
  between sub-cells. The standalone "Furthest detected" card is removed
  from the top strip (it remains in the Records section below).
- **`stats.js` adopts the shared `flagBadge()`** — two ad-hoc inline badge
  renderers in the "New aircraft" and "Frequent aircraft" sections were
  replaced with a single `flagBadge(flags, "short")` call so the new
  Anonymous badge propagates without three more copy-paste edits.

### Fixed

- **`icao_ranges._RAW` was missing Qatar (0x06A000–0x06A3FF) and South
  Sudan (0x06A400–0x06A7FF)** — the `FLAG_ANONYMOUS` audit on the live
  35 k-flight DB flagged 60+ Qatar Airways (A7-Bxx) aircraft as anonymous,
  which is a table-gap bug rather than a real anon contact. Added both
  allocations; the anon-flight count on the same DB dropped 181 → 46
  (97 unique → 33 unique aircraft) after the fix. Added a regression
  test pinning the new ranges.

### Operations

- **Perf, measured on the live 35 k-flight DB:** `/api/flights` page-1 with
  `_FLIGHT_COLS` = 22 ms; full-table stats scan with the anon CASE
  = 379 ms (cached 120 s); `_load_notified` startup scan = 133 ms. The
  CASE expression embeds ~10 KB of state-range conditions into every
  flag-projecting query, but SQLite's prepared-statement cache amortises
  parsing across calls because every call site uses the same string literal.
- **Audit the table when this feature surfaces a clean operator.** If
  the gallery shows a familiar callsign (e.g. `OMS681` SalamAir,
  `T7-WHK` San Marino) as anonymous, look up the hex on
  `https://hexdb.io/api/v1/aircraft/<hex>` first to decide whether it's a
  real anonymous contact or a missing state allocation worth adding to
  `_RAW`. The Qatar miss was the canonical example.

### Tests

- +44 Python tests and +7 JS tests. New Python classes / cases:
  `TestIsAnonymousIcao` (10), `TestAnonymousFlagSql` (4 — SQL/Python
  parity), `TestQatar*` (2 regression pins), `TestAnonymousFlagInResponse`
  (4 end-to-end via `/api/flights`),
  `TestApiFlaggedAircraft::test_filter_anonymous_only` +
  `test_all_filter_includes_anonymous`,
  `TestApiStats::test_anonymous_flights_counted_separately` and
  `test_stats_shape` extended,
  `test_close_flight_keeps_anonymous_hex_with_few_positions` +
  `test_enrich_sets_anonymous_flag_for_non_state_hex`,
  `TestLoadNotified::test_loads_anonymous_icao_without_aircraft_db_row` +
  `test_does_not_load_state_allocated_icao_without_flags`,
  `TestDispatchOne` (2 routing cases),
  `TestNotifyAnonymous` (5). JS: 7 `flagBadge` precedence cases in
  `tests/js/test_table_utils.mjs`. Total suite:
  **1152 Python + 69 JS + 35 Playwright UI**, all passing.

## 1.7.1 — 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **nginx CSP blocks Wikipedia type photos** — `upload.wikimedia.org` was
  missing from the `img-src` directive in `nginx-readsbstats.conf`, causing
  browsers to block the new Wikipedia fallback images with a Content Security
  Policy violation. Added `https://upload.wikimedia.org` to `img-src`.
  Apply by reloading nginx: `sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx`.

### Tests

- Fix race condition in `test_all_three_emergency_squawks_trigger` — the test
  asserted `squawk_calls` immediately after three `_poll()` calls without
  waiting for the async consumer thread to drain the queue, so the last
  notification (7700) was consistently missing on CI. Added
  `_drain_notifications(timeout=1.0)` before the assertion, matching the
  pattern used in every other notification test. Hardened
  `test_emergency_squawk_not_repeated_same_flight` with the same drain call.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Wikipedia type-photo fallback** — the photo lookup ladder gains a sixth
  step that queries Wikipedia for a representative photo when the existing
  chain (Planespotters → airport-data.com → hexdb.io) misses for both the
  specific aircraft and a probe ICAO of the same type. Resolution is a
  two-hop call: Wikipedia's `opensearch` endpoint maps `aircraft_db.type_desc`
  (e.g. `"BOEING 737-800"`) to a canonical article title, then
  `/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{title}` returns `thumbnail` + `originalimage` +
  article URL. Result is stored in `type_photos` with
  `photographer="Wikipedia"` and `link_url` pointing to the article
  (CC-BY-SA attribution). Disambiguation pages, missing thumbnails,
  400 / 404 / 410, and malformed responses all return a clean miss. Closes
  the gap for vintage, military, GA, and rotorcraft types that the commercial
  photo APIs under-cover (e.g. `MIG29`, `C152`, `EUFI`, `H60`, `AN26`,
  `BE20`).
  - **Defence-in-depth URL allowlist** — returned photo URLs are constrained
    to `upload.wikimedia.org` (HTTPS) and the article link to
    `en.wikipedia.org`. A wiki edit pointing the infobox image at an
    attacker-controlled host gets dropped before it lands in the cache.
  - **Telegram alerts benefit automatically** — `notifier._get_photo_result`
    already routes through the shared `resolve_photo` ladder, and Wikipedia
    URLs on `upload.wikimedia.org` pass the existing SSRF guard and the
    10 MB download cap.
  - **New env var** `RSBS_WIKIPEDIA_PHOTO` (default `1`) — set to `0` to
    skip step 6 entirely. Lives next to `PHOTO_CACHE_DAYS` and
    `TELEGRAM_PHOTOS` in `config.py`. Toggling it does **not** invalidate
    already-written `type_photos` rows; use
    `DELETE FROM type_photos WHERE photographer='Wikipedia'` (or
    `DELETE FROM type_photos WHERE thumbnail_url IS NULL` for negative rows)
    to force re-evaluation.

### Changed

- **`web._fetch_type_photo` now delegates to `photo_sources.resolve_photo`** —
  removed ~90 lines of duplicated ladder logic between the web and notifier
  paths. Both code paths share a single source of truth for the
  cache → JOIN → probe → Wikipedia sequence. The async wrapper keeps the
  per-type `asyncio.Lock` and a cache-hit fast path so the hot read avoids
  the executor hop entirely. `resolve_photo` now supports a "type-only" mode
  when called with `icao_hex=""` — steps 1 and 4 (the icao-keyed cache and
  fetch) are skipped so the type-only caller doesn't pollute the `photos`
  table with an empty-key row.

### Fixed

- **Photo credit attribution on the frontend** — the `loadPhoto()` credit
  line in `static/js/table-utils.js` previously hardcoded
  `"© {photographer} via Planespotters.net"` for every hit, which was
  already wrong for airport-data and hexdb hits and would have rendered
  `"© Wikipedia via Planespotters.net"` for the new fallback. Replaced
  with a new `photoSourceSuffix(link)` helper that derives the source
  label from the link URL's hostname (Planespotters.net /
  airport-data.com / hexdb.io / Wikipedia); empty suffix when the link is
  missing or on an unrecognised host.

### Operations

- New log lines at `DEBUG` from the `photo_sources` logger on every
  Wikipedia step-6 outcome (hit / miss / failure) — same convention as
  the rest of the photo chain. For ongoing visibility, query the cache
  directly:

  ```sh
  sqlite3 /mnt/ext/readsbstats/history.db \
    "SELECT type_code, link_url,
            datetime(fetched_at,'unixepoch','localtime') AS fetched
     FROM type_photos WHERE photographer='Wikipedia'
     ORDER BY fetched_at DESC;"
  ```

### Tests

- +23 Python tests and 8 JS tests. `TestFetchWikipediaType` (14 cases)
  covers defensive parsing, host allowlist, percent-encoding, HTTP
  400 / 404 / 410 / 429 / 500 handling, User-Agent header, and missing /
  non-list / non-string field handling. `TestUrlHostMatches` (4) covers
  the host-allowlist helper. `TestResolvePhoto::test_wikipedia_*` (7)
  covers integration with the ladder, including the new type-only mode.
  `TestFetchTypePhoto` and `TestGetPhotoResult` each gain a Wikipedia
  end-to-end test. Existing test classes get an autouse fixture that
  disables `_WIKIPEDIA_ENABLED` so probe-miss tests don't accidentally
  hit the network. Total suite: 1108 Python + 62 JS, all passing.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-05-11

### Security

- **Centralised SSRF guard** — new `src/readsbstats/http_safe.py` module
  enforces HTTPS-only, public-IP-only (rejects RFC1918 / loopback / link-local /
  metadata / reserved / multicast addresses via `ipaddress` checks), no
  auto-redirect, and a per-call response-size cap on every outbound HTTP
  request. Two entry points: `safe_urlopen()` for `urllib` callers and
  `safe_httpx_get()` for `httpx` callers. Adopted by `photo_sources`
  (256 KB / 10 MB caps), `route_enricher` (64 KB; callsign now percent-encoded),
  `adsbx_enricher` (4 MB), and `db_updater` (50 MB).
  `db_updater.AIRCRAFT_CSV_URL` switched to the direct `raw.githubusercontent.com`
  URL so the redirect-blocking policy doesn't break the import.
- **HTML-escape Telegram captions** — `registration`, `callsign`, watchlist
  `label`, `type_desc`, `country`, `squawk`, and the daily-summary DB-JOIN
  columns are all run through `notifier._h()` before HTML interpolation.
  Prior to this, a `&` / `<` / `>` in any of those fields caused Telegram's
  `parse_mode=HTML` to return 400 and the alert was silently dropped.
- **Structure-aware caption clamp** — `_clamp_caption` replaces
  `_truncate_caption`. Over-limit captions first drop the trailing
  `<i>Photo …</i>` note, then the trailing `<a href="…">…</a>` link line,
  then plain-truncate the body with `…`. Prevents the previous cut-in-the-middle
  of an `href=` attribute that would also produce a 400 from Telegram.

### Operations

- **Collector failure alert** — `notify-telegram@.service` fires via `OnFailure=`
  when the collector permanently fails (after exhausting `StartLimitBurst=5`
  restarts). Sends a Telegram message with the last 30 lines of `systemctl status`
  output. Reads `RSBS_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` / `RSBS_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` from the existing
  env file — no extra configuration required.

### Features

- **Shared photo-source module** — `photo_sources.py` centralises the
  Planespotters → airport-data.com → hexdb.io fallback chain. Both the web
  service (`web.py` via `run_in_executor`) and the notifier use the same chain.
  `SOURCES` is the single extension point: append a new callable to add a source.
- **Shared photo lookup ladder** — `photo_sources.resolve_photo()` factors the
  5-step cache → JOIN → fetch → probe ladder used by
  `notifier._get_photo_result`. The web side keeps its own `_fetch_photo` /
  `_fetch_type_photo` split for the asyncio path.

### Bug fixes

- **Telegram photo delivery** — Planespotters blocks hotlink requests from
  Telegram's bot servers. Photos are now downloaded locally (up to 10 MB)
  and uploaded to the `sendPhoto` API as `multipart/form-data`, so the image
  always arrives in the chat. Content-Type detection maps JPEG / PNG / WebP to
  the correct filename. Drops the dead URL-payload fallback (it almost always
  failed for the same reason). Multipart boundary is randomized per upload via
  `secrets.token_hex(16)`.

- **Photo fallback in Telegram alerts** — when no specific aircraft photo exists,
  the notifier now tries airport-data.com and hexdb.io before giving up (previously
  only Planespotters was checked).

### Performance

- **Notification dispatch queue** — `_poll()` no longer spawns a daemon thread
  per call. A single long-lived consumer thread (`tg-dispatch`, started in
  `collector.main()`) reads alerts off `collector._notification_queue` and
  dispatches them serially. The consumer holds one sqlite connection for its
  lifetime (via `notifier._thread_local`) instead of reopening per alert.
  Eliminates thread pileup under bursty alerts; ~5–10 ms saved per alert from
  connection reuse.

## 1.5.2 — 2026-05-09

### Tests

- Deflake `test_index_build_under_concurrent_writes` — on the small CI
  runner the writer thread could be scheduled out for the entire microsecond
  index build and never get its first INSERT in, failing the
  `count > 0` assertion. Added a `threading.Event` barrier so the test
  blocks on the first successful write before the index build begins.
  No production-code change.

## 1.5.1 — 2026-05-09

Production-readiness sweep (seventh audit pass — see
`internal_docs/improvements.md` items #86–101).

### Performance & reliability

- **Per-thread sqlite connections in web** — `web.py::db()` now lazily opens a
  connection per uvicorn worker thread via `threading.local()`. Python's
  per-connection sqlite mutex previously serialised every request through one
  global lock, throwing away WAL's reader concurrency.
- **30 read-only `async def` handlers → `def`** — FastAPI now dispatches them
  to its threadpool, freeing the asyncio event loop. Endpoints that genuinely
  `await` (photo fetchers, heatmap/coverage, feeder checks) stay async.
- **Watchdog heartbeat is now its own thread** — `_watchdog_loop()` ticks every
  20 s independent of the poll loop. A write inside `_poll()` can block on the
  SQLite write lock for tens of seconds while a background `CREATE INDEX` is
  running; the previous inline `WATCHDOG=1` would have missed `WatchdogSec=60`
  and had systemd kill the collector.
- **Single-source background migrations** — `run_background_migrations()` now
  runs only in the collector. Web no longer spawns a duplicate thread that
  would race on the same `CREATE INDEX` and `backfill_bearing` UPDATEs.
- **`/api/dates` cached** (TTL 600 s) — was doing a full GROUP BY scan of
  `flights` on every request even though the result only ticks daily.
- **Partial index `idx_positions_ts_coords`** — `ON positions(ts) WHERE lat IS
  NOT NULL AND lon IS NOT NULL`. Speeds up cold-cache heatmap/coverage when
  many MLAT-only rows have NULL coords.
- **Background helpers guard `conn.close()`** — `_build_positions_indexes` and
  `backfill_bearing` no longer mask a real `connect()` failure with
  `UnboundLocalError` from the `finally` block.

### Security

- **Telegram bot token redacted in error logs** — `notifier._describe_exc()`
  formats `urllib.error.HTTPError` / `URLError` without echoing the request URL
  (which contains `/bot<TOKEN>/`). Defence in depth: current stdlib `__str__`
  doesn't leak the URL, but third-party libs and future stdlib changes might.
- **`safeHttpUrl()` tightened to `^https://`** — the third-party photo
  providers (Planespotters, airport-data, hexdb) all serve over HTTPS already;
  rejecting `http://` closes the MITM window for users on hostile networks.
  Does not affect the readsbstats app's own URLs (those are relative and never
  go through this function), so HTTP-only LAN deployments are unaffected.
- **Auto DB snapshot before purge `--apply`** — `database.snapshot_db()` does
  an atomic `VACUUM INTO <db>.backup-<ts>.db` before any of the three
  `purge_*.py` scripts mutate. `--i-have-a-backup` opts out.

### Tests

- 972 Python tests (was 948) + 54 JS tests. New: per-thread connection
  behaviour, watchdog loop lifecycle, Telegram token-redaction caplog
  assertions, partial-index DDL verification, snapshot helper, concurrent
  writer + index builder, `backfill_bearing` against out-of-range coords,
  notifier "Country: Unknown" fallback.

### Cleanup

- Removed duplicate `end = last_update` assignment in `import_rrd.py`
- uPlot chart instances destroyed on `beforeunload` in `metrics.js`
- `safeHttpUrl()` JS test suite updated to lock the new https-only contract

## 1.1.1 — 2026-04-26

### Security

- Block `javascript:` / `data:` URIs in third-party photo links via a
  `safeHttpUrl()` allowlist
- Require `X-Requested-With` header on watchlist `POST` / `DELETE` (CSRF
  defence — browsers cannot set custom headers cross-origin without a CORS
  preflight that this app rejects)
- Cap watchlist `value` (64 chars) and `label` (255 chars) lengths at the
  Pydantic-model layer; the same caps are enforced in the Telegram `/watch`
  bot command path
- Show only the database filename, not the full path, on `/settings`
- `safeHttpUrl()` now returns the trimmed URL for consistency

## 1.1.0 — 2026-04-24

- Receiver health dashboard with metrics time-series (43 columns) and 9
  health checks (heartbeat, aircraft visibility, message rate, signal drop,
